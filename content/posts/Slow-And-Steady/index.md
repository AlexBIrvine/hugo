## Series Introduction

Growing up an avid reader it always seemed to me that most stories geared towards school kids had a moral to teach. The Emperor's New Cloths taught us to trust in ourselves, Goosebump's Stay Out of the Basement taught us to follow the rules when visiting others, and I guess the Bible's [2 Kings 2:23-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%202%3A23-24&version=NIV;KJV) taught us to respect our elders. As a child who had a hard time navigating the social situations of my life, these morals became something I relied on. I figured they could help guide me through life, or at least impart a lesson that could be spun into an interesting story. When I reached high school, morals became themes that we were expected to look for in the assigned reading. This made me look for them harder to the point where I started to look for them in my own life.

This series is my attempt at creating moral based stories from my time in the work force.

## Cashiering Under the Arches

I landed my first job when I was 15 as a cashier for one of the largest fast food corporations in the world. I'm not going to mention names, but this place loves clowns and the color yellow. I worked there for one year to the day during a very eventful time in their history. During my tenure the company removed the largest drink option in response to a Morgan Spurlock documentary, started accepting credit cards for the first time, and decided that water should no longer be free. That last decision was the one I hated the most since I was the person who had to bear the burden of angry customers who didn't have the quarter for water. If you ever want to see a situation where a grown man threatens a child with violence in broad daylight on camera, just tell him that a cup of water costs 25¢. The sad thing is that it wasn't a one off occurrence, but a daily one.

For those that haven't worked in customer facing roles, you would be surprised to know just how many threats you have to deal with from the general public. The first few times someone threatened me for something stupid I would tell my manager in case they followed through with their words. For the first few times he was angry, claiming that I was trying to use them as an excuse to not work. After several more times he learned that I really was that innocent and laughed at me for having the "thinnest of skin". When I tried to vent to adults about this, the usual response was "Welcome to the real world". I guess it's just to be expected that adults will yell at others when they don't get their way.

Threats over cheap food was only one of the issues that I had to deal with while working with the public. People do not respect the property of strangers and will trash the place at the first given chance. One out of every five customers would just leave their tray on the table and not clean up after themselves. Somehow it was my job to take care of their mess between orders. If they kept their trash on the tray it wouldn't be a gig deal, but often enough the wrappers and scraps would be everywhere but the tray. I wiped ketchup off the bottoms of tables, drug a mop and bucket through the tubular play set, and cleaned puke off the ceiling of the bathroom. If I was too busy ringing up orders to leave my post and clean, then I would have to field the complaints of customers who just couldn't find a clean spot to eat. Apologizing for being busy and suggesting that they clean it themselves was the emotional equivalent of kicking their childhood puppy. Being the only cashier on a busy day, according to the manger, was also my fault somehow. It seems the less money you make, the more things you are at fault for.

## My General Work Ethic and the General Manager

For the things I care about, I've always had high standards. I used to sort my video games by their ranking of quality, would correct everyone on typos when I saw them, and keep my computer files in meticulous order. For things I didn't care about, it was the opposite. My grade point average was a C in high school since I didn't care much for what I was learning, my bedroom always had layers of filth on the carpet, and my body was never in the best of shape. I was an obese child (still am as an adult) since I struggle with self-esteem issues and don't care too much for myself. My work however, that's something I care about. I practice death of the author while writing my autobiography. Say what you want about me (even though all the bullies beat ya to it), but don't you dare wrongly criticize my work.

Annoyingly, this translated into me having a "good work ethic". I would often volunteer myself when asked & try to push myself to be as productive as possible. This was something that the general manager, and small franchise owner, loved dearly. Each time he would come in he would talk with me and tell me how I'm his favorite. According to him I could "go places with the company" and if I kept it up that I would be rewarded handsomely. That made complete sense to me after all, it's the moral I've been taught all my life to that point. You work hard and do the right thing, good things will come your way. America is a meritocracy after all...

When the year reviews came around and we would receive our pay increases based on the merit of our work, this GM conducted the review personally. He made a huge deal about how I was going to receive the highest raise that he was allowed to give out & that I was the example that others my age should follow. The raise? 15¢/hour. Mind you, this was triple the amount that the average person got, but it was still just $6 per week before taxes assuming I worked full time (which I couldn't by law). That's not enough for one meal at the place I worked! When I heard this news, I was dejected. I questioned the GM if that was really all I got, which turned him irate towards me for the remainder of my time there. No longer was I a golden child of sorts, but just another "entitled millennial". Now that I think about it, this might have been the first time of countless many that my generational name was used as a slur towards me.

## The Raise's Aftermath

There's nothing like a crappy reward to make you not want to put effort toward the behavior that earned it. From that review forward, I started to not work as hard as I did before. My strong work ethic still made it impossible for me to slack off, and I still made sure that I performed better than the average employee, but I no longer volunteered myself for everything (just most things). For some reason, this angered most of the managers there. Apparently working harder than most isn't enough when it's less than I was doing before. They tried to guilt trip me with that 15¢ raise, saying it's unfair for me to slack off when I'm being paid the most of my peers. Either way, I was now in cross hairs of all the managers above me and was seen as the example of what not to do. It's amazing in hindsight how quickly I went from naive child to person with malicious intent according to them.

Everything I did from that point was over scrutinized. If there was anything off about my workstation, it was assumed to be my fault. That grease stain embedded into the plastic counter top that was there before I was hired? I should have found a way to clean it. The manager on duty not ordering fries the week before and now I have to tell the angry hoard they can't have fries with that? It's my fault they are angry, obviously. For as consistent as the business is being able to run thousands of locations with an army of teenagers, the people running the show seemed to be just as inconsistent in their opinion of others. I've seen abused dogs have less mood swings than fast food management.

Under this new level of scrutiny, nothing I did seemed good enough. So with the outcome of any action being predetermined I did what any worker would do:

## I Busted My Ass to Impress

When I saw the opportunity to go above and beyond in order to impress management, I took it. When the shake machine would be down, I was the first to offer to repair it. Bathroom needs cleaned? I got you! One day after a very busy lunch rush the dishwasher was backed up. I was an extra cashier at the time with not much to do, so I offered to run back there and help clean up. Due to the amount of dirty dishware the troth sink was overflowing, so all three of us worked extra fast to keep up. It was shocking physical to keep up the pace needed to get ahead, but we put in the work to get it done. Through literal blood, sweat and burns we were able to get it done. Yeah, I might have scratched myself on old metal and gave myself a second degree burn with the heat of the water, but I was an Eagle Scout who knew first aid. No need to complain or report, I was able to handle myself.

After that rush everything slowed down to a crawl. All the dishes were clean, the lobby was clean, and my station was clean. I took the few minutes I earned to relax and just admire the hard work that we did. During this time, the GM walked in and saw a bunch of us standing around not doing anything. This threw him into a near fit of rage! He started to go off on all of us, saying how lazy we were. "If you have time to lean, you have time to clean" he said. He then started to point me out and state how nobody should just stand around like I was! This got to me since I just poured myself (literally considering my injuries) into my work and his company. I argued back with him using me as an example, stating how he didn't witness the rush that made him a ton of money that day. What followed was a second lecture on how there's always work to do, no time to rest! As long as I'm on the clock, I need to find something to be busy with! In the off chance that everything is clean, I should keep cleaning it so a customer doesn't see me just standing around. Nothing ruins the appetite of a fast food consumer than a cashier doing nothing!

That was the last straw for me and I started to look for another place to work that day. I ended up quickly finding an amazing fit that I will write about later in this series, but that's a story for a different day.

## The Moral of the Story?

**If you work hourly, don't be efficient.** There's nothing to gain from efficiency. You get paid the same amount, you have to work the same hours, and your merit increases are not worth the headache. If you have 2 hours of work to complete in an 8 hour day, work at 25% capacity so your day is full.

Unfortunately for me, this lesson wouldn't really sink in until I was 30 or double my age at the time. Each job after the first I busted my ass looking for that promotion, only to be "too good" to promote in some cases. The workforce, generally speaking, doesn't seem to incentivize efficiency at many levels. As a systems thinker, this has always bothered me. What we teach kids about the workplace is so far from the truth it hurts.
