## Series Introduction

Growing up an avid reader it always seemed to me that most stories geared towards school kids had a moral to teach.  The Emperor's New Cloths taught us to trust in ourselves, Goosebump's Stay Out of the Basement taught us to follow the rules when visiting others, and I guess the Bible's [2 Kings 2:23-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%202%3A23-24&version=NIV;KJV) taught us to respect our elders.  As a child who had a hard time navigating the social situations of my life, these morals became something I looked for in the stories that I read.  I figured they could help guide me through life, or at least impart a lesson that could be used in some way.  When I reached high school and was expected to look for the themes in the assigned reading, these morals stood out even more to me.
